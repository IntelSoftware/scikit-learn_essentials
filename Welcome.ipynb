    "These initial hands-on exercises introduce you to concepts of Intel(r) Extension for Scikit-learn. It will provide **basic code examples** for using sklearn algorithms which have have been optimzied in the Intel(r) Extensions for scikit-learn* or its subordinate library, daal4py. Explore simple approaches for invoking SYCL context against a multitude of sklearn algorithms: \n",

    "These hands-on exercises present how to use Data parallel Control (**dpCtl**) to manage different devices, usage of the classes and the functions of dpCtl as well as the underlying **sklearn-ex and daal4py**  libraries to specify a device context such as a gpu, or run the same code on a cpu, or target a simple distributed compute exmaple targeting multiple processes using a \"single program multiple data\", **spmd**, approach. The example will focus on just kmeans on a 9999 x 20 dense dataset.\n",

    "These hands-on exercises show how to build a an application that tests **multiple classification algorithms and hyperparameters** within a single device context in an iterative approach. The data consist of two interescting synthesized galaxies having different galactic planes. One goal is to **classify the membership of each star** within its most likely galaxy using just a few percent of each galaxies stars as labels - and to do this using a variety of classifcation aglorithms.  A second goal is to **demonstrate the KDtree approach** to finding nearest neighbors or finding all sets of lying within 3 light years of another neighbor. See the exnteded version of the code below.\n",
